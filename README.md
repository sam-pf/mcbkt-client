# Library mcbkt client

Library modules that can be used by clients of the MCBKT engine of UKDE by
Physics Front.

## Javascript

The javascript module `mcbkt_client` can be found in folder `js`.  This
module is written in pure javascript without using any external library.
However, the library is written using some features of ECMAScript6 (AKA ES6
or ECMAScript 2015; [see here for ES6 features](http://es6-features.org)).

This means that it should be used with up-to-date browsers.  [See here for
ES6 compatibility information](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
for various browsers.

## Python

Coming soon.
